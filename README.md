# 🚗 Waze Churn Prediction

A churn prediction analysis project using data from a fictional Waze-like navigation app. The goal is to identify potential churners and understand usage patterns using SQL and/or Python.

## 📌 Objective

Predict which users are likely to churn based on their activity history, engagement, and app usage.

## 🛠 Tools & Tech

- Python (Pandas, Matplotlib, Scikit-learn)
- Tableau
- Git & GitHub

## 📂 Project Structure
```bash
waze-churn-analysis/
├── data/ → Raw dataset CSVs
├── notebooks/ → Jupyter notebooks for EDA & modeling
├── visuals/ → Charts, graphs, screenshots
├── README.md → You're here
├── .gitignore 
```

## 🔍 Key Steps

- Data Cleaning & Transformation
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Feature Engineering
- Model Building 
- Final Insights & Recommendations

## 📊 Sample Insights

- Users who drive less than 5km/day have a 60% higher churn rate
- Weekend-only drivers are more loyal
- Churn peaks after new version rollouts

## 🖼 Visuals

## 💡 Conclusion

This analysis helps Waze teams identify at-risk users, optimize app features, and reduce churn.
