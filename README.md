# 🚗 Waze Churn Prediction

A churn prediction analysis project using data from a fictional Waze-like navigation app. The goal is to identify potential churners and understand usage patterns using SQL and/or Python.

## 📌 Objective

Predict which users are likely to churn based on their activity history, engagement, and app usage.

## 🛠 Tools & Tech

- SQL / MySQL
- Python (Pandas, Matplotlib, Scikit-learn)
- Power BI or Tableau (if used)
- Git & GitHub

## 🔍 Key Steps

- Data Cleaning & Transformation
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Feature Engineering
- Model Building (if applicable)
- Final Insights & Recommendations

## 📊 Sample Insights

- Users who drive less than 5km/day have a 60% higher churn rate
- Weekend-only drivers are more loyal
- Churn peaks after new version rollouts
